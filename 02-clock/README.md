## JavaScript clock

##### This is a simple `JavaScript` clock. It displays the time based on the user's computer.

### What I practiced

- `transform` and `transform-origin` property that deals with `rotate`

### Changes I made

##### Besides the original project, I have added some of my own changes.

- fixed the glitch that happens due to the `transition` property when the second gets 60
- UI redesign
