# Drum Kit

### This is a simple drum kit project built using `JavaScript`. It allows you to play various drum sounds by either clicking on the on-screen drum pads or by using the corresponding keyboard keys.

## Overview

### This project is part of the [Javascript 30](https://www.javascript30.com) tutorial series, which is a fantastic resource for practicing your vanilla JavaScript skills.

## What I have learned

- `transitionend` event

```javascript
  keys.addEventListener('transitionend', code to be executed...)
```

- working with `data attributes`

## Changes I made

### Besides the original code provided by the tutorial I have added some of my own changes.

- play the keys by clicking the buttons on the UI
- replaced property deprecated by the browser
