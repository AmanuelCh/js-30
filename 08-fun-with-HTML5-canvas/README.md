## Fun with Canvas

##### This is a project in which I worked with `canvas API`. I got a general insight regardless of how graphics are rendered on the web and how to work with canvas in order to display a draw.

### What I practiced

- drawing on `2d` context
- manipulating different methods of a context
- utilizing state variables
